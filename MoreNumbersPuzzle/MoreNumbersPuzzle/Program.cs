/*
Use nested for loops to generate a list of all the two digit numbers which are less than or equal to 
fifty-six, and the sum of whose digits is greater than ten.
Use another set of nested for loops to find a two-digit number such that the number itself minus 
the number reversed is equal to the sum of its digits.
For example, 72 is not such a number because 72-27 (which is 45) is not the same as the sum of its digits 
(2+7 = 9).
Finally, put the code for each of the two parts into its own separate function, and have a menu 
in main() which allows you to choose which of the two sets to find. This main program should keep repeating 
until you choose to quit (use a do-while loop for this).
